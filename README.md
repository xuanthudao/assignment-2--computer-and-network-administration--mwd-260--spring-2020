3. Clone your fork, using either the web site or the GitHub Desktop client.
4. Checkout your personalized branch, the one with your name and GitHub user handle.

## Directions
All your answers must be included in the fenced region marked by back ticks and the word `bash`.

## Due Date
‚è∞ **Monday, 30 March 2020, at 10:30 AM. At that time, the repo will be closed and will not accept any more submissions. üö´ _No late work will be accepted._**

---

## Submission
Issue a pull request back into the original repo, the one from which your forked was created, before the deadline. [Look at these videos](http://code-warrior.github.io/tutorials/git/github/) for help on how to do so.

**Note**: This assignment may *only* be submitted via GitHub. üö´ **_No other form of submission will be accepted_**.

## / 1 Create a Global Pre Commit Hook
Write a global pre-commit hook that reports whether a commit is the first or subsequent commit to the repo, and also checks for un-necessary whitespace in a file, such as trailing whitespace on a line and extra newlines. You will need to modify `pre-commit.sample`, which is available under `.git/hooks` in every basic Git repo on your machine. (**50pts**)

A new commit should generate the following output:

```
```

Every subsequent commit should generate the following output:

```
```

Trailing whitespace on a line and extra newlines should generate the following output:

```
```

When you‚Äôre done, do the following:

A. Copy the contents of your global Git config settings and paste it below. Use the following command to do so: `git config --global | pbcopy`. (This assumes you‚Äôve installed the environment profile from our class‚Äô examples folder.)

```bash
[user]
	email = thegaoranger@gmail.com
	username = xuanthudao
[init]
	templatedir = ~/.git-templates
```

B. Place the entire contents of your pre commit hook in the included file `pre-commit`.

## /2 Flush and Backup a File
Write a script that backups the `/var/log/kern.log` file to a file called `kern.log.backup`, then resets its contents to an empty file. Your script in this case should return 0. If `/var/log/kern.log` is empty, do nothing and return an exit status of `1`. Echo the status of each event in the script. For example, before copying the log file, indicate that the script is about to copy the file. Make the interaction with the script as informative as possible. Add the contents of your finished script to the included `kernel-log-backup.sh`. (**50pts**)
